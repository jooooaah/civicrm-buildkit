To quickly add settings to all sites running through this deployment of
buildkit, simply create a `*.php` file in a suitable directory.

Learn more about how the settings files work by reading about [civicrm.settings.d](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/tools/civibuild/#settings-civicrm) in the Developer Guide.

Files which end in `*.php.ex` are examples which can be copied.
